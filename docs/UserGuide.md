# MyCelia User Guide

{: .highlight }
*MyCelia — named after mycelium, the underground network that keeps fungi connected. Because your business relationships deserve the same.*

MyCelia is a command-line-driven desktop application for B2B delivery coordinators. Manage your business contacts and track outgoing deliveries — all from a single keyboard-driven interface. No clicking around. Just type and go.

## Quick Start

That's it. MyCelia creates its data files on first launch and loads sample data so you can get your bearings immediately.

Follow these steps to get MyCelia running:

1. Ensure Java 17 or above is installed.
    * Full guide for installation [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html)

   {: .important }
   Mac users: Make sure to use this precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest version of MyCelia [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/releases).
    * Download the `.jar` file.

3. Open a terminal for your Operating System (OS) and launch MyCelia:

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
cd PATH_TO_FOLDER_WITH_JAR_FILE
java -jar vendorvault.jar
```

You're all set! MyCelia should come with Sample Data for you to get started on using the basic features.

## What's Inside

MyCelia keeps track of two books simultaneously:

* **Company Book** — your directory of business partners, suppliers, and clients
* **Delivery Book** — your log of outgoing deliveries linked to those companies

Switch between them with a single command or via the UI tabs. Everything saves automatically.

### The Interface

MyCelia can be used entirely by keyboard, but several actions are also accessible through the UI directly.

### Navigation Bar

At the top of the window is a pill toggle bar with navigation buttons:

|Button|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Companies**|Switch to the Company Book — same as typing `switch` from the Delivery Book|
|**Deliveries**|Switch to the Delivery Book — same as typing `switch` from the Company Book|
|**Routes**|Switch to the Routes tab to view route plans|
|**Help**|Open the help window — same as typing `help`|

### Command Terminal

<img src="images/command-terminal.png" width="600" alt="Command Terminal" />

|Box|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Input**|Type commands here. A hint line below shows the expected format as you type, and a dropdown suggests matching commands.|
|**Response**|Displays the system's response to your last command|

Switching tabs clears the command input, since commands are tab-specific.

Every UI action has an equivalent command. Use whichever feels faster for your workflow.

### Help Window

The help window provides a link to this user guide.

### Company Book View

<img src="images/company-book.png" width="600" alt="Company Book" />

The Company Book view shows all your business contacts. Each entry displays the company name, phone number, email, address, and any tags assigned to it. Below is the location the data is saved.

### Delivery Book View

<img src="images/delivery-book.png" width="600" alt="Delivery Book" />

The Delivery Book view shows all logged deliveries. Deliveries marked as delivered will display a `delivered` tag. You can check individual deliveries using their checkboxes to select them for route planning. A **Plan Today's Route** button at the top of the list becomes active when at least one delivery is selected — clicking it opens the Routes tab and plans the route. Below is the location the data is saved.

### Routes View

<img src="images/route-view.png" width="600" alt="Routes View"/>

The Routes view displays an interactive map with the optimised route for selected deliveries. Switch to it using the **Routes** pill button, or trigger it automatically via the `route` command or the **Plan Today's Route** button.

## Commands

### Global Commands

These commands work in both the Company Book and Delivery Book.

|Command|Format|What it does|
|-|-|-|
|`switch`|`switch`|Toggle between Company Book and Delivery Book|
|`set`|`set a/ADDRESS`|Set your delivery origin address (used as the starting point for route planning)|
|`help`|`help`|Open the help window|
|`exit`|`exit`|Save and close|

---

Manage your network of business contacts. These commands are active when you're in the Company Book.

|Command|Format|Example|

|Find|`find KEYWORD \[MORE\_KEYWORDS]...`|`find acme tech logistics`|
|List all|`list`|`list`|
|Clear all|`clear`|`clear`|

**Company prefixes:**

|Prefix|Field|Required|

|`n/`|Company name|Yes|
|`p/`|Phone number|Yes|
|`e/`|Email address|Yes|
|`a/`|Physical address|Yes|
|`t/`|Tag (repeatable)|No|

---

### Delivery Book

Track outgoing deliveries. Use `switch` or the Deliveries tab to get here from the Company Book.

|Command|Format|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Add|`add pr/PRODUCT c/COMPANY dl/DEADLINE a/ADDRESS \[t/TAG]...`|`add pr/Industrial Printer c/Acme Supplies dl/2026-03-25 14:30 a/10 Anson Road t/urgent`|
|Edit|`edit INDEX \[pr/PRODUCT] \[c/COMPANY] \[dl/DEADLINE] \[a/ADDRESS] \[t/TAG]...`|`edit 1 dl/2026-03-26 09:00 a/20 Harbour Front Walk t/fragile`|
|Delete|`delete INDEX`|`delete 2`|
|Mark delivered|`mark INDEX`|`mark 1`|
|Unmark|`unmark INDEX`|`unmark 1`|
|Select for routing|`select INDEX [INDEX]...`|`select 1 3 5`|
|Clear selection|`select none`|`select none`|
|Plan route|`route`|`route`|
|Find|`find KEYWORD \[MORE\_KEYWORDS]...`|`find printer laptop`|
|List all|`list`|`list`|
|Sort company by deadline|`sort c/COMPANY`|`sort c/Acme Supplies`|
|Clear all|`clear`|`clear`|

**Delivery prefixes:**

|Prefix|Field|Required|
|-|-|-|
|`pr/`|Product name|Yes|
|`c/`|Company name|Yes|
|`dl/`|Deadline (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`)|Yes for `add`, optional for `edit`|
|`a/`|Delivery address|Yes|
|`t/`|Tag (repeatable)|No|

**Notes on specific commands:**

- **`list`** — shows all deliveries and re-sorts the entire list by deadline (earliest first). Use this to reset after a `find` or `sort` filter.
- **`sort c/COMPANY`** — filters to a specific company's deliveries and sorts them by deadline. The company name must match exactly (case-insensitive). Use `list` to return to the full view.
- **`select INDEX [INDEX]...`** — checks the deliveries at those indices for route planning. Repeating an index has no effect. Use `select none` to clear the entire selection. Individual deliveries can also be checked/unchecked via their checkboxes in the list.
- **`route`** — opens the Routes tab and plans the optimised route for all currently selected deliveries. Requires at least one delivery to be selected. Equivalent to clicking **Plan Today's Route**.

## How Storage Works

* All data saves automatically after every command — no manual save needed
* Company records live in `addressbook.json`
* Delivery records live in `deliverybook.json`
* Both files are created in the same folder as the jar on first launch
* To back up, copy both JSON files somewhere safe
* To transfer to another machine, move the jar and both JSON files together

---

## Built With

* Java 17
* JavaFX
* Jackson (JSON serialisation)
* JUnit 5 (testing)
