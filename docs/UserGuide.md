> _Keeping your business network connected_

MyCelia is a command-line-driven desktop application for B2B delivery coordinators. Manage your business contacts and track outgoing deliveries — all from a single keyboard-driven interface. No clicking around. Just type and go.

## What's Inside

MyCelia runs two books simultaneously:

* **Company Book** — your directory of business partners, suppliers, and clients
* **Delivery Book** — your log of outgoing deliveries linked to those companies

Switch between them with a single command or via the UI tabs. Everything saves automatically.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Java 17 or later

```
java -jar MyCelia.jar
```

That's it. MyCelia creates its data files on first launch and loads sample data so you can get your bearings immediately.

---

## The Interface

MyCelia can be used entirely by keyboard, but several actions are also accessible through the UI directly.

### UI Tabs and Buttons

**Action tabs:**

![UI Tabs and Buttons](images/action-tabs.png)

|Tab|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Help**|Opens the help window — same as typing `help`|
|**Exit**|Saves all data and closes MyCelia — same as typing `exit`|

**Command terminal**:

**Book tabs**:

|Tab|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Companies**|Switches to the Company Book — same as typing `switch` from the Delivery Book|
|**Deliveries**|Switches to the Delivery Book — same as typing `switch` from the Company Book|

Every UI action has an equivalent command. Use whichever feels faster for your workflow.

### Help Window

### Company Book View

### Delivery Book View

## How Data Works

* All data saves automatically after every command — no manual save needed
* Company records live in `addressbook.json`
* Delivery records live in `deliverybook.json`
* Both files are created in the same folder as the jar on first launch
* To back up, copy both JSON files somewhere safe
* To transfer to another machine, move the jar and both JSON files together
