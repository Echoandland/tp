_MyCelia — named after mycelium, the underground network that keeps fungi connected. Because your business relationships deserve the same._

# MyCelia User Guide

MyCelia is a command-line-driven desktop application for B2B delivery coordinators. Manage your business contacts and track outgoing deliveries — all from a single keyboard-driven interface. No clicking around. Just type and go.

<img src="images/ui-overview.png" width="700" alt="MyCelia Main Window" />

---

## Quick Start

That's it. MyCelia creates its data files on first launch and loads sample data so you can get your bearings immediately.

Follow these steps to get MyCelia running:

1. Ensure Java 17 or above is installed.
    * Full guide for installation [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html)

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
⚠️ **Important:**

 Mac users: Make sure to use this precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
</div>

2. Download the latest version of MyCelia [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/releases).
    * Download the `.jar` file.

3. Open a terminal for your Operating System (OS) and launch MyCelia:

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
cd PATH_TO_FOLDER_WITH_JAR_FILE
java -jar vendorvault.jar
```

You're all set! MyCelia should come with Sample Data for you to get started on using the basic features.

## Features

### Before you begin


> MyCelia manages two separate books. Commands are **context-specific** — make sure you're in the right book before running a command.

| Book | What it contains | 
|------|-----------------|
| **Company Book** | Your directory of business partners, suppliers, and clients | 
| **Delivery Book** | Your log of outgoing deliveries linked to companies | 

Switch between them with a single command or via the UI tabs. Everything saves automatically.

---

### The Interface

MyCelia can be used entirely by keyboard, but several actions are also accessible through the UI directly.

### Navigation Bar

<img src="images/navigation-bar.png" width="800" alt="Navigation Bar" />

At the top of the window is a pill toggle bar with navigation buttons:

|Button|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Companies**|Switch to the Company Book — same as typing `switch` from the Delivery Book|
|**Deliveries**|Switch to the Delivery Book — same as typing `switch` from the Company Book|
|**Routes**|Switch to the Routes tab to view route plans|
|**Help**|Open the help window — same as typing `help`|

### Command Terminal

<img src="images/command-terminal.png" width="800" alt="Command Terminal" />

|Box|What it does|
|-|-|
|**Input**|Type commands here. A hint line below shows the expected format as you type, and a dropdown suggests matching commands.|
|**Response**|Displays the system's response to your last command|

Switching tabs clears the command input, since commands are tab-specific.

Every UI action has an equivalent command. Use whichever feels faster for your workflow.

### Help Window

<img src="images/help-window.png" width="800" alt="Help Window" />

The help window provides a link to this user guide.

### Company Book View

<img src="images/company-book.png" width="600" alt="Company Book" />

The Company Book view shows all your business contacts. Each entry displays the company name, phone number, email, address, and any tags assigned to it. Below is the location the data is saved.

### Delivery Book View

<img src="images/delivery-book.png" width="600" alt="Delivery Book" />

The Delivery Book view shows all logged deliveries. Deliveries marked as delivered will display a `delivered` tag. You can check individual deliveries using their checkboxes to select them for route planning. A **Plan Today's Route** button at the top of the list becomes active when at least one delivery is selected — clicking it opens the Routes tab and plans the route. Below is the location the data is saved.

### Routes View

<img src="images/route-view.png" width="600" alt="Routes View"/>

The Routes view displays an interactive map with the optimised route for selected deliveries. Switch to it using the **Routes** pill button, or trigger it automatically via the `route` command or the **Plan Today's Route** button.

---

### Storage

* All data saves automatically after every command — no manual save needed
* Company records live in `addressbook.json`
* Delivery records live in `deliverybook.json`
* Both files are created in the same folder as the jar on first launch
* To back up, copy both JSON files somewhere safe
* To transfer to another machine, move the jar and both JSON files together

---

<div class="note" markdown="1">
📝 **Note:**

A company can have any number of tags, or none at all.
</div>

<details>
<summary>What companies are considered duplicates?</summary>

<p>A company is considered a duplicate if it has the <strong>same name and email</strong> as an existing entry. Company names are case-insensitive for matching purposes.</p>

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

Deadlines must follow the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`. Company matching is case-insensitive.
</div>

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I back up my data?</summary>
<ul>
<li>Locate the folder where MyCelia's <code>.jar</code> file is stored.</li>
<li>Copy both <code>addressbook.json</code> and <code>deliverybook.json</code> to a safe location of your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both files contain all your company and delivery data respectively.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I edit my data directly?</summary>
<ul>
<li>Locate the folder where MyCelia's <code>.jar</code> file is stored.</li>
<li>Open <code>addressbook.json</code> or <code>deliverybook.json</code> in a text editor.</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning" markdown="1">
⚠️ **Warning**

Follow the file format carefully. Files that do not conform to the required format will be considered invalid and MyCelia may not load them.
</div>
<p><code>addressbook.json</code> — stores company details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "persons": [ {
    "name": "NAME",
    "phone": "PHONE",
    "email": "EMAIL",
    "address": "ADDRESS",
    "tags": [ "TAGS" ]
  } ]
}</code></pre>
<p><code>deliverybook.json</code> — stores delivery details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "deliveries": [ {
    "product": "PRODUCT",
    "company": "COMPANY",
    "deadline": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm",
    "isDelivered": false,
    "tags": [ "TAGS" ]
  } ]
}</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>I edited the data file directly and MyCelia has some missing data. What should I do?</summary>
<p>Try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Restore from backup</strong> — if you copied the JSON files before editing, replace the broken files with your backup copies.</li>
<li><strong>Fix it</strong> — if no backup exists, look through the JSON files and correct any fields which do not fit the format. Reboot MyCelia after fixing it.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I transfer my data to another computer?</summary>
<ol>
<li>Install MyCelia on the new computer.</li>
<li>On your old computer, locate the folder containing the <code>.jar</code> file.</li>
<li>Copy <code>addressbook.json</code> and <code>deliverybook.json</code> to an external drive or cloud storage.</li>
<li>On the new computer, replace the newly created JSON files with the ones from your old computer.</li>
<li>Relaunch MyCelia — your data should appear exactly as before.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why did my route planning fail to assign some deliveries?</summary>
<p>Route planning requires at least one delivery to be selected. Use <code>select INDEX</code> or check the delivery's checkbox in the list, then run <code>route</code> again.</p>
<p>Also ensure your origin address has been set with <code>set a/ADDRESS</code>.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is my route planning taking so long?</summary>
<p>Route planning requires an internet connection. If it is taking too long, please switch to a better connection.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does adding a delivery fail even though the company exists?</summary>
<p>Company matching is case-insensitive but must be an exact name match — no partial matches. Make sure the name in <code>c/COMPANY</code> matches the name stored in the Company Book exactly.</p>
<p>Use <code>list</code> in the Company Book to verify the exact company name.</p>
</details>
