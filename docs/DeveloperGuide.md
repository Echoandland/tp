### Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.svg)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![ArchitectureSequenceDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg)

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

![ComponentManagers](diagrams/ComponentManagers.svg)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](diagrams/UiClassDiagram.svg)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts, including the `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `RoutePanel` and the panels used to display book-specific data.

Unlike the original AB3 design, MyCelia supports two distinct operating contexts: the **Company Book** and the **Delivery Book**. The UI updates according to the current active book, displaying either `CompanyListPanel` or `DeliveryListPanel`. This allows both workflows to coexist within a single application window.

The UI component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in corresponding `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the displayed company list or delivery list can be updated automatically.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the UI depends on it to parse and execute commands.
* depends on classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Company` and `Delivery` objects stored in the application state.
* reflects the current mode of the application, allowing users to switch between the Company Book and Delivery Book through commands or the navigation bar pill toggle buttons.

This design supports MyCelia’s keyboard-first interaction model while keeping the interface intuitive for users managing both company and delivery information.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![LogicClassDiagram](diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.svg)

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The Logic component is responsible for parsing and executing user commands.

In MyCelia, command parsing depends on the **currently active book**. Since the application supports both the **Company Book** and the **Delivery Book**, the Logic component routes user input to different parsers depending on the current mode stored in the `Model`.

More specifically:

1. When the user enters a command, the `LogicManager` receives the full command text.
2. The `LogicManager` checks the current application mode from the `Model`.
3. If the application is in Company Book mode, the input is passed to the company-side parser.
4. If the application is in Delivery Book mode, the input is passed to the delivery-side parser.
5. The selected parser creates the corresponding `Command` object.
6. The command is executed by the `LogicManager`.
7. The result of command execution is returned as a `CommandResult` object.

This separation is necessary because several command words, such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `filter`, and `listr`, are shared by both books but operate on different types of data. For example, `add` in the Company Book creates a `Company`, while `add` in the Delivery Book creates a `Delivery`.

The Logic component therefore uses book-specific parsers to avoid overloading a single parser with too many context-dependent branches. This improves maintainability and makes it easier to extend each workflow independently.

How the `Logic` component works:

* `LogicManager` acts as the main coordinator for command execution.
* Parsing is delegated to a parser appropriate for the current mode.
* The parser returns a concrete subclass of `Command`.
* The command interacts with the `Model` during execution.
* After execution, the `CommandResult` is returned back to the UI.

This design allows MyCelia to support two related but distinct workflows in a single application while preserving a consistent command-first user experience.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command in Company Book mode:

![ParserClasses](diagrams/ParserClasses.svg)

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.svg)

The `Model` component stores the in-memory state of MyCelia.

Unlike the original AB3 model, MyCelia manages two related sets of domain data: the **Company Book** and the **Delivery Book**. As a result, the `Model` component stores both `Company` objects and `Delivery` objects, together with their corresponding filtered lists for display and command execution.

The `Model` component,

* stores all `Company` objects in the Company Book.
* stores all `Delivery` objects in the Delivery Book.
* stores the currently filtered company list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Company>`, so that the UI can automatically update when the displayed company data changes.
* stores the currently filtered delivery list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Delivery>`, so that the UI can automatically update when the displayed delivery data changes.
* stores a mode flag indicating whether the application is currently operating in Company Book mode or Delivery Book mode.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on the `UI`, `Logic`, or `Storage` components, since the model represents the domain state of the application independently of how it is displayed, parsed, or persisted.

This design allows MyCelia to support two related workflows in a single application while keeping the company and delivery data logically separated.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.svg)

The `Storage` component is responsible for persisting MyCelia’s data on disk and reading it back when the application starts.

Since MyCelia manages both company data and delivery data, the storage layer is responsible for saving and loading both parts of the application state, in addition to user preferences.

The `Storage` component,

* can save both company-related data and delivery-related data in JSON format, and read them back into the corresponding model objects.
* can save and load user and user preference data.
* acts as the bridge between the hard disk representation of the application state and the in-memory model representation.
* depends on classes in the `Model` component because its purpose is to serialize and deserialize domain objects owned by the model.

This design ensures that changes made to either the Company Book or the Delivery Book can be preserved across application restarts while keeping persistence concerns separate from the in-memory business logic.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delivery-Company dependency

#### Implementation

To facilitate deliveries to an assigned company, MyCelia allows the user to create deliveries with reference to an existing company.

Internally, `AddCommand` does not store only a raw company name. Instead, it stores a `CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and uses it during execution to search the existing Company Book for a matching company. 

This design allows for changes within a `Company` to be reflected on the deliveries, reducing the need for users to manually edit every delivery if there is a change to the company.

Example:

Step 1: User enters `add p/Laptop c/Dell d/2026-03-25 14:30 t/urgent`

Step 2: Command is parsed by `DeliveryBookParser` and `AddCommand#execute(Model)` is called

Step 3: `AddCommand#findMatchingCompany(Model, CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate)` is called which filters the existing companies by names.

Step 3a: If existing company with matching name is found, the `Company` instance will be passed on as a return value.

Step 3b: If there are no existing company with a matching name, `null` value is returned.

Step 4: If there is an existing company, `Delivery` will be created using the instance of `Company` found, otherwise a `CommandException` is thrown

Step 5. The model checks for duplicates and adds the delivery to the Delivery Book.

Step 6. The UI refreshes and shows the newly added delivery.

The following diagram demonstrates how the `AddCommand` happens through the `Logic` component
![DeliverySequenceDiagram-Logic](diagrams/DeliverySequenceDiagram-Logic.svg)

### Switch book feature
#### Implementation

MyCelia supports two operating modes: the Company Book and the Delivery Book.
This feature is facilitated by a mode flag stored in the Model component through `Model#getCompanyPackage()` and `Model#setCompanyPackage(boolean)`. The flag determines which parser and book-specific command set should be active at a given time.

At the user level, the command used is `switch`. In the Company Book, `SwitchCommand` sets the mode flag to false, which switches the application to the Delivery Book. In the Delivery Book, `SwitchCommand` sets the mode flag to true, switching back to the Company Book. The User Guide also states that this same command toggles between the two books, and that the navigation bar pill buttons provide an equivalent interaction.

This design allows MyCelia to reuse a single command box and window while exposing two different workflows. Instead of launching separate applications or windows, the system keeps both books in memory and changes only the active context. This keeps interaction fast and matches the product’s keyboard-first design.

Example:

Step 1. The user is currently viewing the Company Book.

![SwitchStateDiagram1](diagrams/SwitchState1.svg)

Step 2. The user enters `switch`.

Step 3. `switch` is parsed by `AddressBookParser` and `SwitchCommand#execute(Model)` is called.

Step 4. The command updates the model mode flag by calling `Model#setCompanyPackage(false)`.

The following diagram demonstrates how the switch command goes through the `Logic` component starting from CompanyBook:

![SwitchSequenceDiagram](diagrams/SwitchSequenceDiagram-Logic.svg)

Step 5. The logic manager switches to `deliveryBookParser` and UI updates to show the Delivery Book instead.

![SwitchStateDiagram2](diagrams/SwitchState2.svg)

#### Design considerations

Alternative 1 (current choice): Store both books in the same model and toggle the active mode with a boolean flag.
- Pros: Simple control flow, easy to integrate with one shared UI shell, and low overhead when switching.
- Cons: Parsers and UI logic need to consistently respect the current mode.

Alternative 2: Split the app into two separate windows or two separate applications.
- Pros: Stronger separation between workflows.
- Cons: Poorer user experience and more duplicated logic for shared functionality such as help, exit, and storage handling.

### Delivery routing
#### Implementation

MyCelia allows users to query a Routing API to obtain an efficient travel plan for the chosen deliveries. This feature allows for users to view an optimized path they can take to finish their deliveries within their stipulated deadlines.

This is done using the `SelectCommand` which takes in the indexes of the chosen deliveries as argument. After selection, the `RouteCommand` is used to check the selected deliveries for their deadlines and addresses, ensuring both fields are valid before being sent as a request to the API.

This design boosts the functionality of MyCelia while simultaneously handling any exceptions that may arise from invalid delivery deadlines or location.

Example:

Step 1: The user inputs `select 1 2 4` to select deliveries 1, 2 and 4 for routing.

Step 2: `Logic` executes the `SelectCommand` which shows the selected deliveries on the UI, allowing the user to check their selection.

The following diagram illustrates how the select command goes through the `Logic` component:

![SelectSequenceDiagram](diagrams/SelectSequenceDiagram.svg)

Step 3: The user confirms their selection and inputs `route`.

The following diagram illustrates how the select command goes through the `Logic` component:
![RouteSequenceDiagram](diagrams/RouteSequenceDiagram.svg)

Step 4: `RouteCommand` calls that `planRoutesFor()::RoutePanel` which checks for overdue deadlines and geocodes the addresses into coordinates using `GeocodingService`. If all deliveries are valid, a request is built via `OptimizationService` and sent to the API.

Step 5: `OptimizationService` parses the response from the API and returns the `RouteResult`.

Step 6: `RoutePanel` displays the `RouteResult` on the UI

The following diagram illustrates the entire process when `planRoutes()` is called:
![RouterSequenceDiagram](diagrams/RouterSequenceDiagram.svg)

### Routing API Key Security

#### Overview

MyCelia uses the [OpenRouteService (ORS)](https://openrouteservice.org/) API for geocoding and route optimisation. API requests require an authentication key. To prevent the key from being exposed in source code or intercepted from JVM memory, MyCelia uses a layered key resolution strategy with a secure subprocess execution model.

#### Key resolution order

When a routing request is made, `OrsHttpClient` attempts to resolve the API key in the following order:

1. **`KeyDeriver` (release builds)** — The real `KeyDeriver.java` is encrypted with git-crypt and only available to maintainers. 

2. **Local key file (development builds)** — If `KeyDeriver.java` is the stub (see below), `OrsHttpClient` falls back to reading the key from a plain text file at:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\MyCelia\ors.key`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/MyCelia/ors.key`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/MyCelia/ors.key`

#### Development setup (for contributors)

The real `KeyDeriver.java` is git-crypt encrypted and **not available in the public repository**. The repository ships a stub at `src/main/java/seedu/address/routing/security/KeyDeriverStub.java` instead. The Gradle build automatically copies this stub to `KeyDeriver.java` if the real file is absent, so the project compiles out of the box without any manual setup.

For routing to work during development, contributors need a personal ORS API key:

1. Register for a free key at [https://openrouteservice.org/](https://openrouteservice.org/)
2. Create the file `ors.key` in your MyCelia app data directory (the path is printed in the error message if routing is attempted without one)
3. Paste your API key as the only content of the file, with no extra whitespace

The Bootstrapper creates an `ors.key` placeholder file with instructions on first launch.

#### Release builds (for maintainers)

Release builds use the real `KeyDeriver.java`, which is stored encrypted in a separate private repository. To obtain access for a release build, contact the project maintainers. The release pipeline (`./gradlew packageRelease`) expects the decrypted `KeyDeriver.java` to be present at build time.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Never commit a real ORS API key in plaintext** to any repository, public or private. Use only the `ors.key` file approach for development, and the encrypted `KeyDeriver.java` for releases.</div>

## Appendix: Effort

### Difficulty & Challenges

1. While AB3 deals with `Address Book`, our app handles and integrates two distinct entities — companies and deliveries — which are directly linked to each other.

2. Integrating an external API required securing sensitive credentials using git-crypt, adding an additional layer of complexity to the development workflow.

3. Ensuring consistent and expected behaviour across the company-delivery link was non-trivial — changes to a company could affect its associated deliveries, requiring careful coordination across the codebase.

4. Hard to navigate initially due to the large inherited AB3 codebase and layered architecture.

5. Extensive testing was needed due to the increased system complexity from managing two linked entities simultaneously.

6. Maintaining consistency across the application — commands had to behave predictably for both companies and deliveries, including parsing, validation, and user feedback.

### Effort & Achievements

1. Higher implementation effort required due to the more complex scope of managing two linked entities rather than one.

2. Successfully secured API credentials using git-crypt, ensuring sensitive data is never exposed in the repository.

3. Deepened existing features and created new features that complement the company-delivery relationship.

4. Conquered integration challenges to keep the company and delivery books in sync while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

5. Carefully reviewed each other's pull requests before merging to ensure code quality.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 4

1. **Show a warning when adding a delivery with a past deadline** — currently the app accepts any valid date format regardless of whether the deadline has already passed. Adding a warning for past deadlines would help users catch accidental data entry errors.

2. **Support multiple products per delivery** — currently each delivery tracks a single product. Enhancing add in the Delivery Book to accept multiple p/ prefixes would better reflect real-world delivery scenarios where multiple products are shipped together.

3. **Add specific error messages are shown to let user know what went wrong** - currently the text turns red and a valid example will be shown for all forms of invalid command usage. It will be more suitable to indicate to user exactly which field is missing or invalid.
